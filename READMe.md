Hello World!

My name is Nick Iannone and I am a Junior Java Developer that recently graduated from Tech Elevator, a 14-week Java coding bootcamp where students learn how to develop dynamic web-based software systems using the Java programming language along side a bevy of other tools / technologies.

*** This is my first repo and a few of my very first attempts at full-stack development. Any and all constructive feedback is welcome! ***

My first two projects do a good job of highlighting my inner geek and my passion to have fun with code. 

REGen (Random Encounter Generator) is a command-line game styled after a Dungeons and Dragons style encounter. You can create characters, set the parameters for an encounter, or generate a random encounter. Encounters pit the player character against 1 - 5 enemies in a battle to the death. Players can cast spells, make weapon attacks, or... run away! I am working on building out a more immersive front end using Vuejs, which will be coming in the next couple of weeks!

Side Kick is a comic book collection assistant, allowing registered users to create a digital representation of their physical comic collection. Users can add comics using an external API search funtion, powered by a resource called ComicVine. In addition to tracking down hard-to-find comics with the search function, users can also trade with other registered users, and build out a wishlist for those pie-in-the-sky wants. I am looking to add a functional marketplace, expand the search functionality, and creating message boards for some good ol' comic book banter.
