Hello World!

My name is Nick Iannone and I am a Junior Java Developer that recently graduated from Tech Elevator, a 14-week Java coding bootcamp where students learn how to develop dynamic web-based software systems using the Java programming language along side a bevy of other tools / technologies.

*** This is my first repo and a few of my very first attempts at full-stack development. Any and all constructive feedback is welcome! ***
